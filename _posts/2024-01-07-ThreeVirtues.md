If you've been in the field of software development for any amount of time, you've likely heard of the [three virtues of a great
 programmer](https://thethreevirtues.com/). And, as a software developer myself, I can say I've expressed each of these 
at some point in my career. These three virtues are also applicable to software testers, especially if they are testers who can code. 
But there are three more virtues of great _software testers_ that rarely talked about. They are:

* **Suspicious** Even though someone promised it doesn't need to be tested, or that it has already been tested, doesn't mean it works. 
* **Skeptical** Just because it worked that time, doesn't mean it'll work the next time. 
* **Unscrupulous** Even if a "customer won't do that", doesn't mean it isn't broken. And yes, I'm still logging this defect.
